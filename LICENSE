findings of such analysis to any party provided that such findings are provided
simultaneously and in identical form to the Licensor; or

1.3.2    resell the Software provided that you procure that the purchaser is
bound by the terms of this Licence Agreement for the benefit of the Licensor and
that you indemnify the Licensor against all costs (including legal costs)
charges and expenses incurred by the Licensor as a result of the failure by you
to comply with the provisions of this paragraph and/or the resale by you of the
Software to the purchaser.

1.4    If you are a purchaser who has obtained lawfully the Software other than
by direct purchase from the Licensor you may carry out the functions on the
terms specified in paragraph 1.3.1 above and, in consideration of the Licensor
agreeing to provide updates of the Software to you during the Licence Period,
either directly or via the relevant intermediary or intermediaries, you agree to
be bound by this Licence Agreement directly in favour of the Licensor.

2.    LICENSEE'S WARRANTY AND UNDERTAKINGS

4.    EXTENSIONS

4.1       In this Licence Agreement "Extension" means all programming additions
made by a Licensee or on his behalf or with his concurrence to the Software
using the Burp Extender API (as hereinafter defined) to either

4.1.1    extend the functionality of the Software or any other software produced
by the Licensor; or

4.1.2    enable the Software or any other software produced by the Licensor to
inter-operate with other software;

but not to copy, clone, reproduce or emulate any existing feature of any
software produced by the Licensor;

and "Burp App" or "BApp" means an Extension adopted by the Licensor pursuant to
this clause.

4.2       "Burp Extender API" means the official Burp Extender application
programming interface available as part of the Documentation.

4.3       Extensions may be created for the use of the Licensee Provided that if
any such Extension is published (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
include sharing such Extension with another Licensee or a third party unless the
party to which the Extension is provided is either a client of the Licensee and
the relevant Extension has been created for use on an engagement for that or
another client of the Licensee, or another Licensee within your organisation)
the Licensee shall notify the Licensor and provide to it a copy of such
Extension and the Licensee agrees that any such Extension shall, at the option
of the Licensor, become either

4.3.1    a Burp App; or

4.3.2    part of the Software.

4.4       When the creation of an Extension is notified to the Licensor or
shared publicly and comes to the attention of the Licensor the Licensor has the
option to make the Extension a Burp App (Burp App, or BApp) after having carried
out the necessary checks to ensure that the Extension is efficacious and
suitable for use with the Software.

4.5       The Licensor has established the BApp Store product feature where Burp
Apps are described and may be downloaded without charge for use as an Extension.

4.6       By designating an Extension a Burp App the Licensor warrants that the
Extension has been checked by the Licensor and has been deemed suitable for use
with the Software.

4.7       All Extensions and Burp Apps remain the property of the author but by
creating such Extension, the author has granted an irrevocable perpetual licence
free of charge to the Licensor to incorporate such Extension in the Software at
the Licensor's option and an irrevocable perpetual licence free of charge to all
Licensees who download the Burp App from the BApp Store.

4.8       If, at the sole option of the Licensor, the Licensor incorporates an
Extension into the Software a notice will be placed on the BApp Store to that
effect.

4.9    The Licensor retains the right without incurring any liability to the
Licensee to disable without notice any Burp App being used by the Licensee where
the Licensor considers in its sole discretion that use of such Burp App with the
Software is problematical.

5.     BURP COLLABORATOR

5.1    The Licensor has developed Burp Collaborator which is a component of the
Software’s automated and manual testing tools. Burp Collaborator involves the
Licensee deploying a system on the public web (the "Collaborator Server") which
acts as the recipient of third-system interactions that may be triggered by
payloads that the Software sends to target systems enabling the detection of
certain types of vulnerability. A full description of the functionality of Burp
Collaborator forms part of the Documentation.

5.2    The functionality of Burp Collaborator gives rise to issues that require
careful consideration by the Licensee as fully set out in the Documentation. By
utilising any features of the Software that may cause interaction with Burp
Collaborator, the Licensee will be deemed to have read the relevant
Documentation, fully understood the functionality and the alternative methods of
utilisation of Burp Collaborator and considered the consequences of utilisation
for its organisation and as a result of such consideration has decided that Burp
Collaborator, in the form utilised by it, is suitable and appropriate for use by
it. The Licensor considers Burp Collaborator to be efficacious in identifying
vulnerabilities of the target website in connection with third-system
interactions, but the Licensee must make its own evaluation before using the
Burp Collaborator Server in one of the alternative manners set out in the
Documentation.

6.    BURP INFILTRATOR

6.1    The Licensor has developed Burp Infiltrator which is a component of the
Software for instrumenting deployed applications in order to facilitate testing
using the Software. Burp Infiltrator involves the Licensee deploying or
procuring deployment of the Infiltrator component within the target system which
enhances the ability of the Software to detect certain types of vulnerability. A
full description of the functionality of Burp Infiltrator forms part of the
Documentation.

6.2    The functionality of Burp Infiltrator gives rise to issues that require
careful consideration by the user as fully set out in the Documentation. By
deploying or procuring deployment of the Infiltrator tool, the Licensee will be
deemed to have read the relevant Documentation, fully understood the
functionality of Burp Infiltrator and considered the consequences of utilisation
for its organisation and any bespoke consultancy clients of the Licensee and, as
a result of such consideration, has decided that Burp Infiltrator is suitable
and appropriate for use by it and by any client of the Licensee. The Licensor
considers Burp Infiltrator to be efficacious in helping to identify
vulnerabilities of the target website, but the Licensee must make its own
evaluation before utilising Burp Infiltrator in the manner set out in the
Documentation.

6.3    If the Licensee causes its client to install Burp Infiltrator as part of
a bespoke consultancy permitted pursuant to clause 1.3.1 above, by so doing it
warrants to the Licensor that it has recommended to the client to install Burp
Infiltrator on its system and has discussed with the client the contents of the
Documentation relating thereto and the potential consequences of such
installation.

7.     INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

7.1    You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in the Software and
the Documentation anywhere in the world belong to the Licensor, that rights in

7.3    The integrity of this Software is protected by technical protection
measures (TPM) so that the intellectual property rights, including copyright, in
the Software of the Licensor are not misappropriated. You must not attempt in
any way to remove or circumvent any such TPM, nor apply or manufacture for sale
or hire, import, distribute, sell or let for hire, offer or expose for sale or
hire, advertise for sale or hire or have in your possession for private or
commercial purposes any means the sole intended purpose of which is to
facilitate the unauthorised removal or circumvention of such TPM.

8.    LICENSOR'S WARRANTY

8.1    The Licensor warrants that for a period of 90 days from the date of

described in the Documentation and the facilities and functions of any Burp App
meet your requirements.

8.3    You acknowledge that the Software and the Burp Apps may not be free of
bugs or errors, and agree that the existence of minor errors shall not
constitute a breach of this Licence.

8.4    If, within the Warranty Period, you notify the Licensor in writing of any
defect or fault in the Software in consequence of which it fails to perform
substantially in accordance with the Documentation, and such defect or fault
does not result from you having amended the Software or used it in contravention
of the terms of this Licence, the Licensor will, at its sole option, either
repair or replace the Software, provided that you make available all the
information that may be necessary to help the Licensor to remedy the defect or
fault, including sufficient information to enable the Licensor to recreate the
defect or fault.
